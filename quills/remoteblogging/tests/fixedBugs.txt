Test-cases for fixed bugs in quills.remoteblogging
==================================================

The test-case class should have made self.mwenabled, self.blogid, self.appkey
and self.bloguserid available to us.  We'll check that (and save a few
keystrokes in this file).

  >>> mwenabled = self.mwenabled
  >>> appkey = self.appkey
  >>> blogid = self.blogid
  >>> bloguserid = self.bloguserid

Given that the object is MetaWeblogAPI-enabled (probably by some sort of ZCML
configuration), we should be able to lookup the appropriate view on it.  First
we need a bit of infrastructure.

  >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
  >>> request = TestRequest()

Now we can lookup the view.

  >>> mwview = getMultiAdapter((mwenabled, request), name='metaWeblog')

Issue #167: Characters illegal for id break image upload
--------------------------------------------------------

Originally, this has been in error in MarsEdit which prepends a slash to
the image name while uploading. However Quills should be robust enough to
cope with blunders like that.

The following is taken from metaweblogapi.txt, except for the 'name'.

  >>> import quills.remoteblogging as qr
  >>> import xmlrpclib
  >>> import os.path
  >>> path = os.path.dirname(qr.__file__)
  >>> img = file('%s/tests/quills_powered.gif' % path, 'rb').read()
  >>> encImg = xmlrpclib.Binary(img)

Now we can add the file through the metaweblog API.

  >>> imgupstruct = {'name'     : u'/name-with-a-slÃ¤sh.gif',
  ...                'type'     : 'image/gif',
  ...                'bits'     : encImg,
  ...                'title'    : 'A Special title that could be ignored',
  ...               }
  >>> resp = mwview.newMediaObject(blogid, 'username', 'password', imgupstruct)
  >>> resp.has_key('url')
  True
